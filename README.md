ReproSwipe is repro of SwipeView challenge. In summary while event fires on swipe, I'm unable to identify which item was acutally swapped this in turn prevents removing correct item from data set.

This is taken from a larger project and just shows subset of problem. Hoping to figure this out with help of others as needed. JB
